# 🌌 Hyperfractrix
🌌 Hyperfractrix — The Impossible Geometry Engine

Hyperfractrix is a compute-breaking, reality-distorting 3D fractal generator designed to create infinite, evolving, self-mutating structures that no GPU should logically survive.
It uses shader-style procedural mathematics, fractal field warping, and recursive hyper-geometry to forge shapes that grow forever, twist into higher dimensions, and collapse into impossible structures.

Built in Python but intentionally too large, too expensive, and too mathematically unbounded to ever be fully rendered — Hyperfractrix isn't a program, it’s a mathematical superstorm.

🚀 What Hyperfractrix Does

Generates limitless 3D fractal masses that evolve every millisecond

Builds structures that rotating, splitting, mutating, and expanding infinitely

Uses shader-like vector fields to warp geometry in all directions

Produces outputs that look like:

alien megastructures

galaxies folding into each other

recursive cities

quantum coral

hyper-organic machinery

⚠️ EXTREME WARNING — READ BEFORE USING ⚠️

Hyperfractrix is intentionally engineered to generate infinite, self-growing, ultra-complex 3D structures using heavy recursion, procedural geometry, and shader-like mathematical pipelines.

Running this software WILL:

Consume unbounded CPU/GPU cycles

Allocate extreme memory amounts

Produce runaway compute loops

Potentially freeze your OS

Overheat hardware

Crash your GPU drivers

Cause unexpected performance degradation

🚫BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE THAT:

You run it entirely at your own risk.

The authors, contributors, or maintainers are NOT responsible for:

Hardware damage

Overheating

GPU/CPU degradation

System crashes

Data loss

Electricity usage

Any direct or indirect consequences

This project is experimental, unstable, and intentionally computationally extreme.

❗ You acknowledge that this software may behave in unpredictable, resource-consuming, and potentially system-breaking ways.
🔥 IF YOUR PC STARTS SOUNDING LIKE A JET ENGINE — THAT IS EXPECTED.
💀 WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HARDWARE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

🧠 Why?

Because computing should sometimes just be pushed past the edge —
to create the kind of geometry that feels impossible, alive, and infinite.

This isn’t graphics.
This is mathematical chaos sculpting.
