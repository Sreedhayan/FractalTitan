# 🌌 Hyperfractrix
🌌 Hyperfractrix — The Impossible Geometry Engine

Hyperfractrix is a compute-breaking, reality-distorting 3D fractal generator designed to create infinite, evolving, self-mutating structures that no GPU should logically survive.
It uses shader-style procedural mathematics, fractal field warping, and recursive hyper-geometry to forge shapes that grow forever, twist into higher dimensions, and collapse into impossible structures.

Built in Python but intentionally too large, too expensive, and too mathematically unbounded to ever be fully rendered — Hyperfractrix isn't a program, it’s a mathematical superstorm.

🚀 What Hyperfractrix Does

Generates limitless 3D fractal masses that evolve every millisecond

Builds structures that rotating, splitting, mutating, and expanding infinitely

Uses shader-like vector fields to warp geometry in all directions

Produces outputs that look like:

alien megastructures

galaxies folding into each other

recursive cities

quantum coral

hyper-organic machinery

💀 Warning

This project will melt your CPU.
This project will drain your RAM.
This project will break your sanity trying to render even frame 1.

Hyperfractrix is intentionally designed to be beyond runnable, beyond optimized, beyond reasonable.

🧠 Why?

Because computing should sometimes just be pushed past the edge —
to create the kind of geometry that feels impossible, alive, and infinite.

This isn’t graphics.
This is mathematical chaos sculpting.
